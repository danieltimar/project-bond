# How to run the jupyter notebook?

- The `predicting-news-labels` notebook was created in a conda environment.
- The environment can be recreated using the environment.yml by navigating to the project directory and run following command:

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

- The environment can then be activated with

`conda activate project-bond-env`

- Once the environment is active, open `jupyter-lab` and find the notebook!
